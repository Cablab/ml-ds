## Why Scikit-learn

- Apply benefits of machine learning models without having to learn all the math behind it
- Written on Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib
- Very well designed API

### Scikit-learn Workflow

- Get Data Ready
- Pick a model that suits the problem
- Fit the model to the data and make a prediction
- Evaluate the model
- Improve through experimentation
- Save and reload the trained model
