# Machine Learning 101

## What is Machine Learning?

- Trying to make computers act more and more like humans

## Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science

**Artificial Intelligence**: ability of a computer to act like a human
  - **Narrow AI**: AI that's better than humans at 1 specific thing
  - **General AI**: AI that's better than humans at everything (not currently a thing)

**Machine Learning**: Subset of AI to achieve AI through analyzing data and finding patterns

**Deep Learning/Neural Networks**: A type of machine learning. Algorithms

**Data Science**: Analyzing data, overlapping with AI and machine learning

## Types of Machine Learning

**Supervised Learning**: Data already has categories. CSV files with data that is already labeled.
  - **Classification**: Is this A or B?
  - **Regression**: Predict stock price based on examples

**Unsupervised Learning**: CSV file without column names or labels
  - **Clustering**: Give the machine a bunch of data points, let the ML algorithm decide what the groups/labels are
  - **Association Rule Learning**: Associate data to predict something in the future

**Reinforcement Learning**: Teaching machine through trial and error, reward and punishment. Machine doesn't know what it's doing at first, but over time it learns how to maximize the desired outcome (score in video game)
